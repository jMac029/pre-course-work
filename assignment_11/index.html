        <h2>There is no Coding Pill...</h2>
        <p>This has been a problem for me ever since I started to learn to code. I've bought books, tutorials and website memberships all designed to teach you how to code or build this or that. Some of these I complete some I do not, especially when it comes to the books. I have collected many overtime and I always get the feeling that when I start the book and read the first few chapters I have mastered it. Perhaps secretly I wish that I could just hold the book up to my foreward and absorb all of it's materials, perhaps in the future this might be possible.

        <h2>Not a Spectator Sport...</h2>
        <p>Like the "Coding Pill" I have also struggled with this. I have done many coding tutorials or "how to's" online. They are fun and I do learn things, I also get a great sense of accomplishment when completing them and showing off what I made with people. But if I was asked to recreate what I made from scratch without the tutorial I woudl be lost. Another example would be if I followed a tutorial to say build an Apple Watch app that had a feature for an app that I wanted to build I would find it hard to take what I learned from the tutorial and apply it to something I actually wanted to build. I found that once I finished the tutorials I could never start from scratch without having something to start from.
