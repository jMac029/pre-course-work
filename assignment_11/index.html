        <p>I attended the UCI Coding BootCamp Demo Day for the first cohort to finish the bootcamp. It was very informative and the students made some exciting final projects. The students gave some great advice to prepare for my upcoming bootcamp that I am planning to implement in the weeks to come. I plan to mostly prepare by doing JavaScript tutorials and projects. All the students really enjoyed the bootcamp and that they learned a lot in the process and feel that they are ready to jump into the job market in junior positions, something that I plan to do as well. With hard work and dedication I know I will showcasing my final projects in 6 months time just how these students were as well.
