        <h2>NoSQL</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>A NoSQL (originally referring to "non SQL" or "non relational")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the "NoSQL" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century,[2] triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com.[3][4][5] NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.[6] NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages.[7][8] Source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">wikipedia</a></p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps.

        <h2>ASP.NET</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>ASP.NET is an open-source[2] server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.
          <br>
          <br>
          It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.
          <br>
          <br>
          ASP.NET's successor is ASP.NET Core. It is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together with other frameworks like Entity Framework. The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler Platform (codename "Roslyn") and is cross platform. ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.[3] Source : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET">wikipedia</a></p>

        <h2>Smalltalk</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language. Smalltalk was created as the language to underpin the "new world" of computing exemplified by "human–computer symbiosis."[2] It was designed and created in part for educational use, more so for constructionist learning, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others during the 1970s.
          <br>
          <br>
          The language was first generally released as Smalltalk-80. Smalltalk-like languages are in continuing active development and have gathered loyal communities of users around them. ANSI Smalltalk was ratified in 1998 and represents the standard version of Smalltalk.[3]
          <br>
          <br>
          Smalltalk took second place for "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017.[4] Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">wikipedia</a></p>

        <h2>Ajax</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML")[1][2] is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.[3] In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.[4]
          <br>
          <br>
          Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.
